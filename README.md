# Easy Chat React

The objective of this challenge will be to build a chat that uses localStorage as a storage source or, if you are using React, you can use useState. In this chat, you can send messages, obviously (no one knew that). Additionally, there must be a system where you can filter messages. When adding a message to the filter, when the user tries to send it, they must block sending. You can also implement an additional system to ban the user from the chat if they reach a limit of sending blocked messages!

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```
